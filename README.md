# Playlist Project

This repository contains the source code for the "Playlist Project," a web platform that creates personalized learning experiences.

### Project Overview

The Playlist Project aims to revolutionize online learning by leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning. Users simply enter a topic they want to learn about, and the platform generates a curated playlist of YouTube videos designed to guide them through the learning process, from beginner to advanced concepts.

### Key Features (Planned)

* **Natural Language Processing:** Understands user queries and identifies relevant keywords.
* **Intelligent Video Search:** Utilizes the Piped API to search YouTube for videos matching the user's query.
* **Personalized Playlist Generation:** Creates tailored playlists based on video relevance, difficulty level, and user preferences.
* **Adaptive Learning:** Recommends new videos based on user history and viewing behavior. (Future implementation)

### Technologies (Planned)

* **Frontend:** React
* **Backend:** ASP.NET
* **Database:** SQLite
* **APIs:**
    * Piped: For YouTube video search
    * Llama AI (or similar NLP model): For natural language processing (to be confirmed)

### Installation (Future)

Detailed installation instructions will be provided once the project reaches a more developed stage.
